        <p><b>Testing and Debugging</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>An exception will produce a stack trace as well as a return value that can be used to deal with the error. A stack trace is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. It’s often not just a single function or method call that causes an error. A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence.</li>
            <li>Errors in programming can fail silently and give unexpected or incorrect results that nobody spots. A ninja programmer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly. In production, a ninja programmer should try to make the code fail gracefully (although not completely silently ― we still need to know there’s an error), so the user experience is not affected, if possible. This is achieved by making sure exceptions are caught and dealt with, and code is tested rigorously.</li>
            <li>The most basic form of debugging is to use the " alert() " method to show a dialog at certain points in the code. Because " alert() " stops a program from running until OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to be. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the best way to practice debugging? In the reading it shows us a lot of ways to do so, but is there a standard practice that we should be used to implementing?</li>
        </ul>
