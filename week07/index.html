        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p><b>Further Functions</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it’s defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition. The function also has to be made into an expression, which is done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses.<br>
            IIFEs are a useful way of performing a task while keeping any variables wrapped up within the scope of the function. This means the global namespace is not polluted with lots of variable names.</li>
            <li>An IIFE can be used to set up any initialization code that there’ll be no need for again. Because the code is only run once, there’s no need to create any reusable, named functions, and all the variables will also be temporary. An IIFE will be invoked once, and can set up any variables, objects and event handlers when the page loads.</li>
            <li>Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming. JavaScript is a single-threaded environment, which means only one piece of code will ever be processed at a time. This may seem like a limitation, but non-blocking techniques can be used to ensure that the program continues to run. Instead of waiting for an event to occur, a callback can be created that’s invoked when the event happens. This means that the code is able to run out of order, or asynchronously.</li>
            <li>The increase in the use of asynchronous programming in JavaScript has meant that more and more callbacks are being used. This can result in messy and confusing 'spaghetti code'. This is when more than one callback is used in the same function, resulting in a large number of nested blocks that are difficult to comprehend. Callback hell is the term used to refer to this tangled mess of code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Ajax</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.</li>
            <li>Asynchronous:<br>
            When a request for data is sent, the program doesn’t have to stop and wait for the response. It can carry on running, waiting for an event to fire when a response is received. By using callbacks to manage this, programs are able to run in an efficient way, avoiding lag as data is transferred back and forth.</li>
            <li>JavaScript:<br>
            JavaScript was always considered a 'front-end' language, not used to communicate with the server. Ajax enabled JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a server, allowing content to be updated in real time.</li>
            <li>XML:<br>
            When the term Ajax was originally coined, XML documents were often used to return data. Many different types of data can be sent, but by far the most commonly used in Ajax nowadays is JSON, which is more lightweight and easier to parse than XML. (Although it has never really taken off, the term Ajaj is sometimes used to describe the technique.) JSON also has the advantage of being natively supported in JavaScript, so you can deal with JavaScript objects rather than having to parse XML files using DOM methods.</li>
            <li>The five most commonly used verbs when dealing with resources on the web are:<br>
                GET requests to retrieve resources<br>
                POST requests, usually used to create a resource but can actually perform any task<br>
                PUT requests to upsert, which means insert a resource or update it entirely<br>
                PATCH requests to make partial updates to a resource<br>
                DELETE requests to delete a resources.<br>
                By default, a link in a web page will make a GET request. Forms are also submitted using a GET request by default, but they will often use a POST request.</li>
        </ul>
