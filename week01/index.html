        <p><b>Master Mobile UX Notes</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>After 2011, mobile devices really took off and designing a disply for this changed drastically because
                of
                it.
            </li>
            <li>Eric Shcmidt said in 2012, "The simple guidline is whatever you are doing - do mobile first."</li>
            <li>Responsive Retrofitting is useful if you already have a desktop web version of your site and need to
                quickly
                get
                it to mobile, but ultimatley you will need to rewrite it for mobile first to better include touch
                interaction
                and address screen real estate issues.</li>
            <li>Doing mobile first helps build for a more friendly user experience and allows for easier growth of the
                website.
                It also constrains bandwidth to make your site work faster and more efficiently.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I followed the code, but what does the "find and edit it" button supposed to do? It seems to clear what
                I
                have written.<br><span style="color: red">Answer: I need to save it first and then type the story name
                    and
                    select the button to pull it back up.</span></li>
        </ul>
