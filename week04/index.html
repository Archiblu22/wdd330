        <h3>Notes/Exercises</h3>
        <p><a href="./team.html">Team Activity: Tic Tac Toe</a></p>
        <p><b>Forms</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that’s been entered. They should be used carefully.</li>
            <li>"input type='password'"is used to enter passwords or secret information. This works in the same way as an input field with "type='text'"", except the characters are concealed as they are entered so they’re unable to be read on the screen.</li>
            <li>With data validation, another useful technique is to disable the submit button if there are errors on the form. If the submit button is disabled then no action is taken when it’s clicked. Most browsers will also display it in a lighter color to indicate that it cannot be clicked on. This prevents users from submitting a form containing any errors. A submit button can be disable by added the "disabled" attribute to the "input" element: <xmp><button type='submit' id='submit' disabled>Submit</button></xmp></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The parentheses are not required when instantiating a new object using a constructor function. The parentheses are required, however, if any default arguments need to be provided. For example, if we want to create anotherDiceobject with four sides, we would have to add 4 as an argument, like so: const whiteDice = new Dice(4);</li>
            <li>By convention, the names of constructor functions or class declarations are capitalized, which is the convention used for classes in class-based programming languages.</li>
            <li>A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using inheritance. It allows more complex objects to be created by ‘mixing’ basic objects together.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Modular JavaScript</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules. This helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files, which improves code maintainability. </li>
            <li>Node.js had already implemented modules before they were introduced in ES6, and used a slightly different notation calledCommon JS modules. At the time of writing it is proving difficult to merge the two notations in an elegant way, although it is expected that Node.js will support ES6 modules in some way in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Are mixins a standard practice or is it typically used only when you need to account for complex sets of data?</li>
        </ul>
