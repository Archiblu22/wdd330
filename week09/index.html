        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p><b>The Window Object</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.</li>
            <li>A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes the URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, the window title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third parameter. This can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can then be referenced later in the code.</li>
            <li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were invented by Netscape as a way of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol. This means that a browser does not remember anything from one request to another. So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered. Cookies can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information that can then be retrieved between requests.</li>
            <li>Cookies can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping cart), authentication and tracking users. The use of cookies for tracking purposes has been much maligned in recent years. Their use for data storage is starting to be replaced in many cases by the new HTML5 localStorage API as it allows more data to be stored. Cookies are still useful for retaining state information (such as if a user is logged in) because they’re passed between the client and server on every HTTP request.</li>
            <li>Cookies are session cookies by default. This means they are deleted once a browser session is finished (when the user closes the browser tab or window). Cookies can be made persistent ― that is, lasting beyond the browser session ― by adding "; expires=date" to the end of the cookie when it’s set, where date is a date value in the UTC String format Day, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>HTML5 APIs</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5 was for HTML what ES6 was for JavaScript – it added a large number of new features to the specification. It also went beyond the actual markup language and brought together a number of related technologies such as CSS and JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are frequently introduced to give developers access, and control new features that appear in the latest devices.</li>
            <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. This information can then be used to filter data based on the user's location or speed and direction of travel.</li>
            <li>The Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background with the added benefit of being able to intercept network requests. This allows you to take alternative action if the network is offline, and effectively create app-like offline experiences. Service workers also allow access to push notifications and background syncing. Service workers require a secure network to run on HTTPS to avoid any malicious code hijacking network requests.</li>
            <li>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications. This is usually a popup in the corner of the screen, but it changes depending on the operating system. An advantage of using the system notification is that they will still be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn't the current tab.<br>
                Before you can send notifications, you need to get permission granted by the user. This can be achieved using the requestPermission() method of a Notification global object.</li>
            <li>Before HTML5, it was notoriously difficult to display audio and video in browsers, and plugins such as Flash often had to be used. HTML5 introduced the <xmp><audio></xmp> and <xmp><video></xmp> tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page. It also introduced a Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
